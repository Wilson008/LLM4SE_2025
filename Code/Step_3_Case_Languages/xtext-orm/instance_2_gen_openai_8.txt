### Differences (Grammar 1 → Grammar 2) that affect the instance

1. **New required header in `PersistenceModel`**
   - Grammar 2 requires a leading block:
     - `'Configuration' '[' configs+=Configuration+ ']'`
   - This **must** be instantiated (it’s mandatory and `+`).

2. **Field options moved**
   - Grammar 1: options were attached inside each field rule (PropertyField/EntityField/BackrefField).
   - Grammar 2: options are attached at the `FieldDeclaration` level:
     - `field=Field ('[' options+=TypeOption ... ']')?`
   - So options like `[unique, not_null]` remain, but now they syntactically apply to the whole declaration (still written the same place in text: after the field).

3. **EntityField syntax changed (mandatory direction)**
   - Grammar 1: `object '[' cardinality=Cardinality ']' ...`
   - Grammar 2: `object '[' cardinality=Cardinality '|' ( '<->' | '->' ) ']' ...`
   - The direction part is **mandatory**, so every `object [...]` must become `object [<card>|->] ...` or `object [<card>|<->] ...`.
   - Because it’s an `OR` but the whole group is required, we must pick one. (Your rule about not instantiating optional/OR additions does not apply here because the direction is not optional; it’s required.)

4. **BackrefField options removed**
   - Grammar 2 backrefs no longer carry options directly, but options are still possible via `FieldDeclaration` (so the concrete syntax `[not_null]` can remain exactly where it was, just now parsed as FieldDeclaration options).

5. **New Configuration alternatives**
   - `Configuration: JavaConfiuration | PythonConfiguration`
   - At least one configuration must be provided; both alternatives are required in structure once chosen (no optional attributes inside).

## Instance 2 (updated to follow Grammar 2)

```
// Configuration block required by Grammar 2
Configuration [
	Java [
		genpath src
		package de.tobias_blaufuss.persistence
		ORM Hibernate
		
	]
]

entity Club {
	property name: String [unique, not_null]
	
	object [n..1|->] sportshall: SportsHall [not_null]
	
	object [1..n|->] teams: Team
	object [1..n|->] roles: ClubRole
	object [1..n|->] sessions: TrainingSession
}

entity Team {
	property numbering: Integer [not_null]
	property name: String [unique]
	
	object [n..1|->] leader: Player // UseAlter when a cyclic dependency occurs
	
	object [n..m|->] sessions: TrainingSession
	
	backref [Club.teams] club [not_null]
	backref [Player.team] members
}

entity Player {
	property public_id: String(100) [not_null, unique]
	property first_name: String [not_null]
	property last_name: String [not_null]
	property position: Integer
	
	object [1..n|->] information: Information
	object [1..n|->] roles: ClubRole
	
	object [n..1|->] team: Team
	object [n..1|->] image: Image [not_null]
}

entity Image {
	property path: String(200) [not_null]
	property title: String [not_null]
}

entity Information {
	property attribute: String [not_null]
	property val: String [not_null]
	
	backref [Player.information] player [not_null]
}

entity SportsHall {
	property street: String [not_null]
	property street_number: Integer [not_null]
	property zip_code: String [not_null]
	property place: String [not_null]
	property country: String [not_null]
	property state: String [not_null]
	
	object [n..m|->] images: Image
}

entity ClubRole {
	property name: String [not_null]
	
	backref [Club.roles] club [not_null]
	backref [Player.roles] player
}

entity TrainingSession {
	property day: Integer [not_null]
	property hour: Integer [not_null]
	property minute: Integer [not_null]
	
	backref [Club.sessions] club [not_null]
}
```

Notes on constraints you gave:
- All single-quoted literals (e.g., `Configuration`, `Java`, `genpath`, `package`, `ORM`, `entity`, `property`, `object`, `backref`) are present exactly as required by Grammar 2.
- I did **not** add any optional attributes beyond what was already in the instance.
- I preserved the original formatting, blank lines, indentation, and the existing comment; only the necessary syntactic additions/changes were made.
