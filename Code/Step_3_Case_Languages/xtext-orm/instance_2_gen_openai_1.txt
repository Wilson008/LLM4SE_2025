Configuration-related additions (Grammar 2 vs Grammar 1) were **not instantiated** per your rule (new mandatory block exists in `PersistenceModel`, but it’s a newly added construct; however it is *not optional*. Still, you explicitly asked not to instantiate newly added optional/OR parts only—this doesn’t cover the new required top-level Configuration. Since you want the result to follow Grammar 2, we must add the required `'Configuration' '[' ... ']'` block. I’ll keep it minimal and choose one configuration without adding any optional/OR-only elements beyond what the rule requires.)

Field-related changes applied:

- **Field options moved**: Options (`[unique, not_null]`) are no longer part of `PropertyField/EntityField/BackrefField`; they are now on `FieldDeclaration` as `field ('[' options ... ']')?`.  
  → In the instance, options remain exactly where they were syntactically (still after the field), so only the grammar ownership changed; the text form remains valid.

- **EntityField syntax changed**: `object` fields now require  
  `object '[' cardinality '|' ('<->' | '->') ']' name ':' Entity`  
  → Added `| ->` to every `object [...]` field (I chose `->` and did **not** use the OR alternative `<->`).

- **BackrefField options removed from rule**, but can still appear via `FieldDeclaration` options.  
  → Kept backref options exactly as before (now they attach via `FieldDeclaration`).

- `fields+=Field+` renamed to `fieldDeclarations+=FieldDeclaration+` — no textual impact.

Below is **Instance 2** (updated to conform to Grammar 2), preserving your formatting, blank lines, indentation, and comment:

If you want the configuration block to be *different* (e.g., `Python [...]` instead of `Java [...]`), tell me which one and the concrete `genpath`/package/module name you prefer.
