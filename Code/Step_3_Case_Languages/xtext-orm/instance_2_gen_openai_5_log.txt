## Differences: Grammar 2 vs Grammar 1

### 1) Model root / top-level structure
- **Grammar 1**: `PersistenceModel` contains only entities:
  - `(entities+=Entity)+`
- **Grammar 2**: `PersistenceModel` starts with a required configuration block, then entities:
  - `'Configuration' '[' configs+=Configuration+ ']' (entities+=Entity)+`
- Impact: Every valid file in Grammar 2 must begin with something like:
  - `Configuration [ ... ]`

### 2) Field options syntax moved “up” from specific fields
- **Grammar 1**: Options (`[unique, not_null]`) are attached **inside** each field rule:
  - `PropertyField` has optional `[...]`
  - `EntityField` has optional `[...]`
  - `BackrefField` has optional `[...]`
- **Grammar 2**: Options are attached at the **FieldDeclaration** level:
  - `FieldDeclaration: field=Field ('[' options+=TypeOption ... ']')?;`
  - And `PropertyField/EntityField/BackrefField` no longer include options.
- Impact: Parsing/AST changes: entities now contain `fieldDeclarations+=FieldDeclaration+` rather than `fields+=Field+`.

### 3) Entity field now encodes directionality
- **Grammar 1** `EntityField`:
  - `object [cardinality] name: EntityRef`
- **Grammar 2** `EntityField`:
  - `object [cardinality | (<-> or ->)] name: EntityRef`
  - Specifically: `'object' '[' cardinality=Cardinality '|' (bidirectional?='<->' | unidirectional?='->') ']' ...`
- Impact: You can explicitly represent bidirectional vs unidirectional relationships in the syntax; Grammar 1 had no such marker.

### 4) Backref field simplified (options removed from rule)
- **Grammar 1** `BackrefField` allowed options directly:
  - `backref [...] name [options]?`
- **Grammar 2** `BackrefField` is just:
  - `backref [...] name`
  - Options, if any, come from the surrounding `FieldDeclaration`.

### 5) Added configuration subsystem (new concepts)
Grammar 2 introduces:
- `Configuration: JavaConfiuration | PythonConfiguration;`
- Java config block with:
  - `genpath` (a `Path`)
  - `package` (an `FQN`)
  - `ORM` (enum `JavaORM`, currently only `Hibernate`)
- Python config block with:
  - `genpath` (a `Path`)
  - `module_name` (an `FQN`)
  - `ORM` (enum `PythonORM`, currently only `SQLAlchemy`)
- New terminal-ish rule: `Path: ID ('/' ID)*;`

### 6) Minor naming / structural changes
- `Entity` content changed:
  - Grammar 1: `fields+=Field+`
  - Grammar 2: `fieldDeclarations+=FieldDeclaration+`
- Typo present in Grammar 2:
  - `JavaConfiuration` (spelling) — if this is unintended, it affects generated Ecore/Java types and references.

### 7) What stayed the same
- Entities still declared as: `entity Name { ... }`
- Property types (`String`, `String(n)`, `Integer`) unchanged.
- `TypeOption` set (`unique`, `not_null`) unchanged in meaning, only relocated syntactically.
- `Cardinality` enum unchanged.
- `FQN` unchanged and still used for backref cross-references (`[EntityField|FQN]`).

If you want, I can also show how your **Instance 1** would need to be rewritten to conform to **Grammar 2** (mainly adding `Configuration[...]` and adding `| ->` or `| <->` inside every `object [...]`).
