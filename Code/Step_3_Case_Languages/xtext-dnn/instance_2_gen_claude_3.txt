=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
Based on my analysis of the differences between grammar_1 and grammar_2, here's the migrated instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2:

```
network "DemoNet" {
	epochs = 10
	batchSize = 50
	imageSize = 28
    imageChannels = 1
    outputLabels = 10

    caffePath = "$CAFFE_HOME"
    outputPath = "/media/xpitfire/data/temp"

	updater -> sgd
	learningRate = 0.003

	conv   (name: "c1" in:data out:64)     { kernelSize = 6 }
    conv   (name: "c2" 		   out:32)     { kernelSize = 3 }
	conv   (name: "c3"         out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }

	branch (name: "b1" in:"c3" out:32)     {
		eltwiseOperation -> PROD

		conv (name: "bc1"      out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }
		norm (name: "bn1")				   { useGlobalStats = true }
		scale(name: "bs1") 				   { useBiasTerm = true }
	}

	pool   (name: "p1"         out:3)      { type -> MAX, stride = 1 }

	dense [(name: "d1"         out:512), 
	       (name: "d2"         out:256)]

	dense  (name: finalLayer  out:labels)
}
```

**Changes applied:**
1. Network attributes: `batch-size` → `batchSize`, `image-size` → `imageSize`, `image-channels` → `imageChannels`, `output-labels` → `outputLabels`, `caffe-path` → `caffePath`, `output-path` → `outputPath`
2. Conv layer: `kernel-size` → `kernelSize`
3. Branch body: `operation` → `eltwiseOperation`, removed `type -> residual` line
4. Norm body: `use-global-stats` → `useGlobalStats`
5. Scale body: `use-bias-term` → `useBiasTerm`
6. Final layer name: `final-layer` → `finalLayer`

All formatting, whitespace, indentation, and comments have been preserved exactly as in the original instance.
