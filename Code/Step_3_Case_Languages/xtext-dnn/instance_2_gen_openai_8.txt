## Differences (Grammar 1 → Grammar 2) that affect the instance

### 1) Renamed keywords in `Network` (all are **single-quoted literals**, so the instance must change)
- `batch-size` → `batchSize`
- `image-size` → `imageSize`
- `image-channels` → `imageChannels`
- `output-labels` → `outputLabels`
- `caffe-path` → `caffePath` (**now optional** in Grammar 2, but Instance 1 already has it, so keep it and rename)
- `output-path` → `outputPath`
- (Also present in grammar but not used in Instance 1): `train-data-path`→`trainDataPath`, `val-data-path`→`valDataPath`

### 2) Renamed keywords in layer bodies
- `ConvLayerBody`: `kernel-size` → `kernelSize`
- `BachNormBody`: `use-global-stats` → `useGlobalStats`
- `ScaleNormBody`: `use-bias-term` → `useBiasTerm`

### 3) `branch` body changed
- Grammar 1 had:
  - `operation -> ...`
  - `type -> residual`
- Grammar 2 has only:
  - `eltwiseOperation -> ...`
- So in the instance:
  - Replace `operation` with `eltwiseOperation`
  - Remove the `type -> residual` line (no longer valid)

### 4) Special layer name literal changed
- `final-layer` → `finalLayer`

No other required changes are needed for Instance 1 to conform.

## Instance 2 (updated to follow Grammar 2)

```dsl
network "DemoNet" {
	epochs = 10
	batchSize = 50
	imageSize = 28
    imageChannels = 1
    outputLabels = 10

    caffePath = "$CAFFE_HOME"
    outputPath = "/media/xpitfire/data/temp"

	updater -> sgd
	learningRate = 0.003

	conv   (name: "c1" in:data out:64)     { kernelSize = 6 }
    conv   (name: "c2" 		   out:32)     { kernelSize = 3 }
	conv   (name: "c3"         out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }

	branch (name: "b1" in:"c3" out:32)     {
		eltwiseOperation -> PROD

		conv (name: "bc1"      out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }
		norm (name: "bn1")				   { useGlobalStats = true }
		scale(name: "bs1") 				   { useBiasTerm = true }
	}

	pool   (name: "p1"         out:3)      { type -> MAX, stride = 1 }

	dense [(name: "d1"         out:512), 
	       (name: "d2"         out:256)]

	dense  (name: finalLayer  out:labels)
}
