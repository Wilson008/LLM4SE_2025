### Differences between Grammar 1 and Grammar 2

#### 1) Network-level keyword/name changes (mostly kebab-case → camelCase)
In `Network:` the following literals changed:

- `image-size` → `imageSize`
- `image-channels` → `imageChannels`
- `batch-size` → `batchSize`
- `output-labels` → `outputLabels`
- `train-data-path` → `trainDataPath`
- `val-data-path` → `valDataPath`
- `caffe-path` → `caffePath`
- `output-path` → `outputPath`

Also: in Grammar 1, `caffe-path` was **required**; in Grammar 2, `caffePath` is **optional**:
- Grammar 1: `'caffe-path' ASSIGN caffePath=STRING &`
- Grammar 2: `('caffePath' ASSIGN caffePath=STRING)? &`

Everything else in `Network` structure/order remains the same.

#### 2) Branch body redesigned
- Grammar 1 `BranchBody` had **two** entries:
  - `'type' -> BranchType` (and it had an enum `BranchType` with `residual`)
  - `'operation' -> OperationType`
- Grammar 2 `BranchBody` has **only one** entry:
  - `'eltwiseOperation' -> OperationType`

So Grammar 2:
- removes the `BranchType` concept entirely (the `enum BranchType` is gone)
- renames `operation` to `eltwiseOperation`
- removes the `type -> residual` field from branch bodies

#### 3) Layer/parameter keyword renames (kebab → camel)
- `kernel-size` → `kernelSize` (in `ConvLayerBody`)
- `use-global-stats` → `useGlobalStats` (in `BachNormBody`)
- `use-bias-term` → `useBiasTerm` (in `ScaleNormBody`)

Pooling body stayed the same (`type -> MAX/AVG`, `stride = ...`).

#### 4) Special “final layer” literal renamed
In `LayerName`:
- Grammar 1 allowed `'final-layer'`
- Grammar 2 allows `'finalLayer'`

So instances must use `name: finalLayer` instead of `name: final-layer`.

#### 5) No changes to terminals/enums except removal of `BranchType`
- `OperationType`, `PoolingType`, `ActivationFunctionType`, `UpdaterType`, `WeightInitType`, and terminals appear unchanged.
- Only `enum BranchType` exists in Grammar 1 and is removed in Grammar 2.

If you want, I can also rewrite *Instance 1* into a valid instance of Grammar 2 (applying all keyword/structure changes).
