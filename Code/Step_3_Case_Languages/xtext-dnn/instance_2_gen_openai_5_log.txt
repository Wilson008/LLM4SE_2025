Response after Instance 1: Stored for future reference.

## Key differences: Grammar 2 vs Grammar 1

### 1) Network keyword/attribute renames (kebab-case → camelCase)
In `Network`:

- `image-size` → `imageSize`
- `image-channels` → `imageChannels`
- `batch-size` → `batchSize`
- `output-labels` → `outputLabels`
- `train-data-path` → `trainDataPath`
- `val-data-path` → `valDataPath`
- `caffe-path` → `caffePath`
- `output-path` → `outputPath`

Semantics look the same; only the literal tokens changed.

### 2) `caffePath` became optional
Grammar 1 required:
- `'caffe-path' = STRING` (mandatory)

Grammar 2 has:
- `('caffePath' = STRING)?` (optional)

So instances valid in Grammar 2 may omit `caffePath`, but Grammar 1 instances must include it.

### 3) Branch body changed (removed BranchType, renamed operation field)
Grammar 1 `BranchBody` had two required entries:
- `'type' -> type=BranchType` (and `BranchType` enum existed)
- `'operation' -> operation=OperationType`

Grammar 2 `BranchBody` has only:
- `'eltwiseOperation' -> operation=OperationType`

Implications:
- Branch “type” concept (e.g., `residual`) is removed from the syntax.
- Keyword `operation` renamed to `eltwiseOperation`.
- `enum BranchType` is removed entirely in Grammar 2.

### 4) Layer/body keyword renames
- `ScaleNormBody`: `use-bias-term` → `useBiasTerm`
- `BachNormBody`: `use-global-stats` → `useGlobalStats`
- `ConvLayerBody`: `kernel-size` → `kernelSize`

### 5) Special final layer name literal changed
In `LayerName`:
- Grammar 1: `'final-layer'`
- Grammar 2: `'finalLayer'`

### 6) What did *not* change (notable stability)
- Overall structure: `Model -> Network`, `layers+=Layer*`
- Layer alternatives and most bodies stay the same (pool/dense/norm/scale/conv constructs remain).
- Terminals and enums (except `BranchType`) are unchanged.
- `PoolLayerBody` keywords remain `type` and optional `stride` (still camelCase? actually unchanged: `stride` is same; pool `type` is same).

## What this means for your Instance 1 (Grammar 1)
To make Instance 1 parse under Grammar 2, at minimum you’d need to:
- Replace the network-level kebab-case keys with camelCase (`batchSize`, `imageSize`, etc.).
- Change `caffe-path` → `caffePath` (and it can be omitted if desired).
- In the branch block:
  - Replace `operation -> PROD` with `eltwiseOperation -> PROD`
  - Remove `type -> residual` entirely (no longer supported by Grammar 2)
- Update:
  - `kernel-size` → `kernelSize`
  - `use-global-stats` → `useGlobalStats`
  - `use-bias-term` → `useBiasTerm`
  - `final-layer` → `finalLayer`

If you want, paste an Instance 2 attempt and I can rewrite Instance 1 into a Grammar 2–compliant version.
