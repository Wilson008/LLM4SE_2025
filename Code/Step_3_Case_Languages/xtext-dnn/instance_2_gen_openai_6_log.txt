Response after Instance 1: Stored Grammar 2 and Instance 1 for future reference.

## Differences: Grammar 2 vs Grammar 1

### 1) Network property keyword renames (kebab-case → camelCase)
In `Network:` these literals changed:

- `image-size` → `imageSize`
- `image-channels` → `imageChannels`
- `batch-size` → `batchSize`
- `output-labels` → `outputLabels`
- `train-data-path` → `trainDataPath`
- `val-data-path` → `valDataPath`
- `caffe-path` → `caffePath`
- `output-path` → `outputPath`

Also note: `epochs`, `seed`, `updater`, `learningRate` stayed the same.

### 2) `caffePath` became optional
- Grammar 1: `'caffe-path' ASSIGN caffePath=STRING &` (required)
- Grammar 2: `('caffePath' ASSIGN caffePath=STRING)? &` (optional)

### 3) Normalization/scale parameter keyword renames
- In `ScaleNormBody`:
  - `use-bias-term` → `useBiasTerm`
- In `BachNormBody`:
  - `use-global-stats` → `useGlobalStats`

### 4) Branch body changed (structure + keywords)
Grammar 1 `BranchBody` had **two** fields:
- `'type' -> BranchType` (and an enum `BranchType` with `residual`)
- `'operation' -> OperationType`

Grammar 2 `BranchBody` has **one** field:
- `'eltwiseOperation' -> OperationType`

And Grammar 2 **removed** `enum BranchType` entirely.

Practical consequence: branch blocks no longer accept:
- `type -> residual`
- `operation -> PROD|SUM`

They now accept:
- `eltwiseOperation -> PROD|SUM`

### 5) `final-layer` renamed to `finalLayer`
In `LayerName`:
- Grammar 1 allowed `'final-layer'`
- Grammar 2 allows `'finalLayer'`

### 6) Everything else is effectively unchanged
Layer alternatives (`conv/pool/dense/norm/scale/branch`), layer tuple syntax, enums (except `BranchType`), and terminals are the same.

## What this means for Instance 1 (Grammar 1 instance)
Instance 1 will not parse under Grammar 2 without edits, mainly due to:
- network keys (`batch-size`, `image-size`, etc.) needing camelCase
- `caffe-path` needing to become `caffePath` (and is optional now)
- branch body lines:
  - `operation -> PROD` must become `eltwiseOperation -> PROD`
  - `type -> residual` must be removed (no longer supported)
- `final-layer` must become `finalLayer`
