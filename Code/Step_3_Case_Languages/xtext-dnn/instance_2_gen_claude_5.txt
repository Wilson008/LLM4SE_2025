=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
Based on the differences between grammar_1 and grammar_2, here's the migrated instance_2 that conforms to the second grammar:

```
network "DemoNet" {
	epochs = 10
	batchSize = 50
	imageSize = 28
    imageChannels = 1
    outputLabels = 10

    outputPath = "/media/xpitfire/data/temp"

	updater -> sgd
	learningRate = 0.003

	conv   (name: "c1" in:data out:64)     { kernelSize = 6 }
    conv   (name: "c2" 		   out:32)     { kernelSize = 3 }
	conv   (name: "c3"         out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }

	branch (name: "b1" in:"c3" out:32)     {
		eltwiseOperation -> PROD

		conv (name: "bc1"      out:32)     { kernelSize = 1 }
		norm (name: "bn1")				   { useGlobalStats = true }
		scale(name: "bs1") 				   { useBiasTerm = true }
	}

	pool   (name: "p1"         out:3)      { type -> MAX, stride = 1 }

	dense [(name: "d1"         out:512), 
	       (name: "d2"         out:256)]

	dense  (name: finalLayer  out:labels)
}
```

**Changes made:**
1. `batch-size` → `batchSize`
2. `image-size` → `imageSize`
3. `image-channels` → `imageChannels`
4. `output-labels` → `outputLabels`
5. Removed `caffe-path = "$CAFFE_HOME"` (now optional in grammar_2, so not instantiated per rule 2)
6. `output-path` → `outputPath`
7. `kernel-size` → `kernelSize` (in all conv layers)
8. `operation` → `eltwiseOperation` (in branch body)
9. Removed `type -> residual` line (BranchType removed from grammar_2)
10. `use-global-stats` → `useGlobalStats`
11. `use-bias-term` → `useBiasTerm`
12. `final-layer` → `finalLayer`

All formatting, whitespace, indentation, tabs, and empty lines have been preserved exactly as in the original instance.
