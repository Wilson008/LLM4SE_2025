Response after Instance 1: Got it—I’ll remember Grammar 1, Grammar 2, and Instance 1 for later reference.

## Differences: Grammar 2 vs Grammar 1

### 1) `MongoBean` header changed (keyword removed)
**Grammar 1**
```xtext
MongoBean:
  'mongobean' name=ValidID '{' ...
```

**Grammar 2**
```xtext
MongoBean:
  name=ValidID '{' ...
```

**Impact**
- In Grammar 2, a bean no longer starts with the literal keyword `mongobean`.
- This is a major syntactic change: Instance 1 (which uses `mongobean Artist { ... }`) would not match Grammar 2 as-is.
- It also increases ambiguity risk: many constructs now potentially start with `ValidID '{' ...`.

### 2) `MongoProperty` can now use an inline/nested bean type
**Grammar 1**
```xtext
MongoProperty:
  type=JvmTypeReference (many?='*')? name=ValidID;
```

**Grammar 2**
```xtext
MongoProperty:
  (type=JvmTypeReference | inlineType=MongoBean) (many?='*')? name=ValidID;
```

**Impact**
- A property’s type can be either:
  - a normal JVM type reference (`String`, `int`, `Iterable<Track>`, etc.), **or**
  - an **inline** `MongoBean` definition (`inlineType=MongoBean`) used as the property type.
- This enables nested bean declarations in places where a type is expected, e.g. conceptually:
  - `Address { String street } address`
- Combined with change (1), note that an inline bean now begins with just an identifier + `{`, since `MongoBean` no longer has the `'mongobean'` keyword. That makes inline types syntactically lightweight but can also raise parsing/ambiguity considerations.

### 3) What did *not* change
- `MongoFile`, `Import`, `AbstractElement`, `PackageDeclaration`, `MongoOperation`, and `QualifiedNameWithWildcard` are effectively the same (except that `MongoBean` itself changed, which affects any rule that references it).
- `MongoOperation` signature and body remain the same, including the syntactic predicate `=>` before the operation header.

## Relation to Instance 1
- Instance 1 is clearly written for Grammar 1 because it uses the `mongobean` keyword for each bean declaration.
- Under Grammar 2, those `mongobean` keywords would become unexpected tokens unless you reintroduce them or adjust the instance accordingly.
