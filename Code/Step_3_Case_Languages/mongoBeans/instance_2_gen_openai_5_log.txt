### Key differences: Grammar 2 vs Grammar 1

1. **MongoBean header changed (keyword removed)**
   - **Grammar 1:**
     ```xtext
     MongoBean:
       'mongobean' name=ValidID '{' ... '}';
     ```
     A `MongoBean` declaration must start with the literal keyword `mongobean`.
   - **Grammar 2:**
     ```xtext
     MongoBean:
       name=ValidID '{' ... '}';
     ```
     The `mongobean` keyword is **no longer required/allowed** by this rule. A bean now starts directly with an identifier followed by `{`.

   **Impact:** Instance 1 (which uses `mongobean Artist { ... }`) would **not parse** under Grammar 2 unless adjusted (e.g., `Artist { ... }`).

2. **MongoProperty type can be inline (nested bean)**
   - **Grammar 1:**
     ```xtext
     MongoProperty:
       type=JvmTypeReference (many?='*')? name=ValidID;
     ```
     Properties must have a JVM type reference (`String`, `int`, `Iterable<Track>`, etc.).
   - **Grammar 2:**
     ```xtext
     MongoProperty:
       (type=JvmTypeReference | inlineType=MongoBean) (many?='*')? name=ValidID;
     ```
     A property can be typed either by:
     - a normal `JvmTypeReference`, or
     - an **inline MongoBean** (`inlineType=MongoBean`)—i.e., you can define a bean type in place.

   **Impact:** Grammar 2 supports constructs like “property whose type is defined inline as a nested bean”, which Grammar 1 cannot express.

3. **Everything else is effectively unchanged**
   - `MongoFile`, `Import`, `AbstractElement`, `PackageDeclaration`, `AbstractFeature`, `MongoOperation`, and `QualifiedNameWithWildcard` are unchanged in structure (aside from any downstream effects caused by the changed `MongoBean` syntax).

If you want, I can also show what Instance 1 would need to look like to be valid under Grammar 2, and give an example of the new inline-type property syntax.
