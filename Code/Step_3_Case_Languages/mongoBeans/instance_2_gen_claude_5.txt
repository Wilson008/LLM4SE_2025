=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
Based on my analysis of the differences between grammar_1 and grammar_2, here is instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2:

```
import java.util.*

package org.musicdb {
	/**
	 * A musical performer
	 */
	Artist {
		String name
		Album* albums
		
		Iterable<Track> getOevre() {
			albums.map[tracks].flatten
		}
	}  
	 
	/**
	 * A record, CD, DVD or another collection of tracks
	 */
	Album {
		String title
		int year 
		Track* tracks
		
		Duration getDuration() {
			tracks.map[duration].reduce[Duration a, Duration b| a + b]
		}
	}
	
	Track {
		String title
		Duration duration
	}
	
	Duration {
		int seconds
	
		void fromString(String duration) {
			val split = duration.split(':')
			seconds = Integer::parseInt(split.get(0)) * 60 + Integer::parseInt(split.get(1))
		}		
		
		String toString() {
			Integer::toString(seconds / 60) + ':' + Integer::toString(seconds % 60)
		}
		
		Duration operator_plus(Duration other) {
			new Duration() [
				seconds = this.seconds + other.seconds
			]
		}
	}
} 
```

**Key change applied:**
- Removed the `mongobean` keyword before each bean declaration (Artist, Album, Track, Duration) since grammar_2 no longer requires this keyword in the MongoBean rule.
- The new optional `inlineType=MongoBean` alternative in MongoProperty was not instantiated, as per instruction #2, since it's a new feature in an OR relationship.
- All comments, whitespace, indentation, and formatting have been preserved exactly as in the original instance.
