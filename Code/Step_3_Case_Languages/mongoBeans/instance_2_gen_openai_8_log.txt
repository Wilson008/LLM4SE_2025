Response after Instance 1: Stored for future reference.

## Differences: Grammar 1 → Grammar 2

### 1) `MongoBean` keyword removed
- **Grammar 1**
  ```xtext
  MongoBean:
    'mongobean' name=ValidID '{' features+=AbstractFeature* '}';
  ```
- **Grammar 2**
  ```xtext
  MongoBean:
    name=ValidID '{' features+=AbstractFeature* '}';
  ```
**Effect:** In Grammar 2, a bean is no longer introduced by the literal keyword `mongobean`. Any `ValidID '{' ... '}'` in the right context can parse as a `MongoBean`.

**Consequence for Instance 1:** As written, `mongobean Artist { ... }` would *not* match Grammar 2 anymore, because Grammar 2 expects the bean to start directly with the name (`Artist { ... }`).

---

### 2) Properties can now have an inline (nested) bean type
- **Grammar 1**
  ```xtext
  MongoProperty:
    type=JvmTypeReference (many?='*')? name=ValidID;
  ```
- **Grammar 2**
  ```xtext
  MongoProperty:
    (type=JvmTypeReference | inlineType=MongoBean) (many?='*')? name=ValidID;
  ```
**Effect:** A property type can be either:
- a normal JVM type reference (`String`, `int`, `Iterable<Track>`, etc.), **or**
- an **inline MongoBean definition** (a nested `{ ... }` bean) used as the property’s type.

So Grammar 2 supports things like (illustrative):
```xtext
Address { String street } address
```
(i.e., inline bean definition on the left, then the property name on the right).

---

### 3) Everything else is essentially unchanged
In particular:
- `MongoFile`, `Import`, `AbstractElement`, `PackageDeclaration`, `AbstractFeature`, `MongoOperation`, and `QualifiedNameWithWildcard` are the same.
- `MongoOperation` signature and body parsing remain the same.

---

## Summary impact on Instance 1
- **Parsing break:** Every `mongobean X { ... }` in Instance 1 would need to become `X { ... }` for Grammar 2.
- **New capability:** Grammar 2 additionally allows defining bean-shaped types inline in property declarations, which Grammar 1 could not express.

Instance 2 has been saved to 'Code\Step_3_Case_Languages\mongoBeans\instance_2_gen_openai_8.txt'.
