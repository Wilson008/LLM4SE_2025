Response after Instance 1: Got it—I’ll treat the three artifacts as remembered for later reference:

- **Grammar 1** (original)
- **Grammar 2** (updated)
- **Instance 1** (example written for Grammar 1)

## Differences: Grammar 2 vs Grammar 1

### 1) `mongobean` keyword removed from `MongoBean`
**Grammar 1**
```xtext
MongoBean:
  'mongobean' name=ValidID '{'
    features+=AbstractFeature*
  '}';
```

**Grammar 2**
```xtext
MongoBean:
  name=ValidID '{'
    features+=AbstractFeature*
  '}';
```

**Effect**
- In Grammar 2, a bean definition starts directly with an identifier (`ValidID`) followed by `{ ... }`.
- Any existing input like `mongobean Artist { ... }` (as in Instance 1) will no longer parse as a `MongoBean` under Grammar 2 unless you adjust the instance text accordingly.

---

### 2) Properties can now use *inline bean types*
**Grammar 1**
```xtext
MongoProperty:
  type=JvmTypeReference (many?='*')? name=ValidID;
```

**Grammar 2**
```xtext
MongoProperty:
  (type=JvmTypeReference | inlineType=MongoBean) (many?='*')? name=ValidID;
```

**Effect**
- A property type can be either:
  - a normal JVM type reference (`String`, `int`, `Iterable<Track>`, etc.), **or**
  - an **inline `MongoBean` definition** (embedded bean syntax) used as the property’s type.
- This enables nested/anonymous-ish structured types inside properties (depending on how you later interpret/compile `inlineType=MongoBean`).

---

### 3) Everything else is effectively unchanged
- `MongoFile`, `Import`, `AbstractElement`, `PackageDeclaration`, `AbstractFeature`, `MongoOperation`, and `QualifiedNameWithWildcard` are the same in structure and intent.
- `MongoOperation` signature/body structure is unchanged.

## Impact on Instance 1 (written for Grammar 1)
- Under **Grammar 2**, every occurrence of:
  ```text
  mongobean Artist { ... }
  ```
  would fail to parse as a `MongoBean` because the literal keyword `'mongobean'` is no longer part of the rule.
- The new inline-type feature isn’t used in Instance 1; it’s an additional capability rather than a change required by that instance.

Instance 2 has been saved to 'Code\Step_3_Case_Languages\mongoBeans\instance_2_gen_openai_1.txt'.
