Response after Instance 1: Stored for future reference.

## Differences: Grammar 2 vs Grammar 1

### 1) `MongoBean` no longer has the `mongobean` keyword
- **Grammar 1**
  ```xtext
  MongoBean:
    'mongobean' name=ValidID '{' ... '}';
  ```
- **Grammar 2**
  ```xtext
  MongoBean:
    name=ValidID '{' ... '}';
  ```
**Effect:** In Grammar 2, any construct that looks like `ValidID '{' ... '}'` can be parsed as a `MongoBean` (depending on surrounding context). In Grammar 1, beans are explicitly introduced with the `mongobean` keyword.

### 2) `MongoProperty` type can now be either a normal JVM type reference or an inline `MongoBean`
- **Grammar 1**
  ```xtext
  MongoProperty:
    type=JvmTypeReference (many?='*')? name=ValidID;
  ```
- **Grammar 2**
  ```xtext
  MongoProperty:
    (type=JvmTypeReference | inlineType=MongoBean) (many?='*')? name=ValidID;
  ```
**Effect:** Grammar 2 adds support for *inline/nested bean type definitions* directly where a property type is expected, e.g. conceptually:
```text
Address { String street } address
```
(where `Address { ... }` is an inline `MongoBean` acting as the property’s type).

### 3) Model/API impact: properties may have `type` OR `inlineType`
Because of the alternation:
- In Grammar 1, every `MongoProperty` has `type`.
- In Grammar 2, a property has either:
  - `type : JvmTypeReference`, or
  - `inlineType : MongoBean`.

### 4) Potential ambiguity / parsing consequences introduced by (1) and (2)
Removing the `mongobean` keyword means `MongoBean` now starts with an identifier, which is a very common prefix. Combined with inline beans inside `MongoProperty`, Grammar 2 introduces new “identifier + `{`” patterns that can compete with other rules in certain contexts (though Xtext can often disambiguate based on the expected feature at that position).

## Note on Instance 1 compatibility
Instance 1 uses the explicit `mongobean` keyword (Grammar 1). Under Grammar 2 as written, those `mongobean Artist { ... }` declarations would no longer match `MongoBean` (unless `mongobean` happens to be accepted as `ValidID`, but as a keyword it typically is not).
