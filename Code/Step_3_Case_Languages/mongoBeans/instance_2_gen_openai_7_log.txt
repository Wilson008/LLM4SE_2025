### Grammar 2 vs Grammar 1 — key differences

1. **`MongoBean` header changed**
   - **Grammar 1:** `mongobean` keyword is required:
     ```xtext
     MongoBean:
       'mongobean' name=ValidID '{' ... '}';
     ```
   - **Grammar 2:** the `'mongobean'` keyword was removed:
     ```xtext
     MongoBean:
       name=ValidID '{' ... '}';
     ```
   **Impact:** In Grammar 2, a bean is introduced by just an identifier followed by `{ ... }`. This is a significant syntax change and can introduce ambiguities (e.g., distinguishing a bean from other constructs that might start with an identifier).

2. **`MongoProperty` now supports inline/nested bean types**
   - **Grammar 1:** a property type must be a `JvmTypeReference`:
     ```xtext
     MongoProperty:
       type=JvmTypeReference (many?='*')? name=ValidID;
     ```
   - **Grammar 2:** a property type can be either a `JvmTypeReference` **or an inline `MongoBean`**:
     ```xtext
     MongoProperty:
       (type=JvmTypeReference | inlineType=MongoBean) (many?='*')? name=ValidID;
     ```
   **Impact:** You can declare “anonymous/inline” structured types directly inside a property declaration, like embedding a bean definition where a type would normally appear.

3. **Everything else is effectively unchanged**
   These rules are identical between the grammars (as written):
   - `MongoFile`, `Import`, `AbstractElement`, `PackageDeclaration`
   - `AbstractFeature`, `MongoOperation`
   - `QualifiedNameWithWildcard`

### Consequence for Instance 1
- **Instance 1 matches Grammar 1** because it uses `mongobean Artist { ... }`, etc.
- **Instance 1 would *not* match Grammar 2 as-is** because Grammar 2 no longer accepts the leading `mongobean` keyword before bean names. You’d have to remove `mongobean` from each bean declaration to make it parse.

If you want, I can also point out where Grammar 2 might become ambiguous (especially due to `MongoBean` starting with `ValidID`) and what common Xtext patterns are used to mitigate that.
