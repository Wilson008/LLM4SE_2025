=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
Based on the differences between grammar_1 and grammar_2, here's instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2:

```
Contract SimpleContract {
	version: "v1.0.0"
	hasReceive
	ownership
	modifiable total integer
	
	validator onlyOwner () {
		message: "Only the contract owner can call this function."
		validation: "msg.sender == owner"
	}
	
	validator validNumber(x integer) {
		message: "The number must be greater than 4"
		validation: "x>4"
	}
	
	method example (x integer, name string, lastname string) -> x integer, name string {
		description: "This is a sample of method"
		validators: onlyOwner, validNumber
		events: XUpdated, NameUpdated 
	}
	
	event XUpdated (x integer){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el numero se ha actualizado"
	}
	
	event NameUpdated(name string){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el name se ha actualizado"
	}
}
```

The changes made are:
1. **"Modifier" → "validator"**: Changed the keyword from "Modifier" to "validator" for both modifier definitions
2. **"modifiers:" → "validators:"**: Changed the keyword in the method from "modifiers:" to "validators:"

Note: The new `DataStore` element was not instantiated because it's optional (in an OR relationship with other elements in the Contract rule).
