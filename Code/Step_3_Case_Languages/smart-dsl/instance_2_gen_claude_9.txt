=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
Based on the analysis of the differences between grammar_1 and grammar_2, here's instance_2 that conforms to grammar_2:

```
Contract SimpleContract {
	version: "v1.0.0"
	hasReceive
	ownership
	modifiable total integer
	
	validator onlyOwner () {
		message: "Only the contract owner can call this function."
		validation: "msg.sender == owner"
	}
	
	validator validNumber(x integer) {
		message: "The number must be greater than 4"
		validation: "x>4"
	}
	
	method example (x integer, name string, lastname string) -> x integer, name string {
		description: "This is a sample of method"
		validators: onlyOwner, validNumber
		events: XUpdated, NameUpdated 
	}
	
	event XUpdated (x integer){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el numero se ha actualizado"
	}
	
	event NameUpdated(name string){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el name se ha actualizado"
	}
}
```

**Changes made:**
1. `Modifier` → `validator` (keyword change on lines 6 and 11)
2. `modifiers:` → `validators:` (keyword change on line 15)

**Not instantiated:**
- The new `DataStore` element was not added because it's optional (in an OR relationship with other elements in the Contract rule)

All formatting, whitespace, indentation, comments, and structure have been preserved exactly as in the original instance.
