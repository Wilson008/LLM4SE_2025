=== Step 3: Instance Transformation ===
Based on the differences between grammar_1 and grammar_2, here's the migrated instance that conforms to the second grammar:

```
Contract SimpleContract {
	version: "v1.0.0"
	hasReceive
	ownership
	modifiable total integer
	
	validator onlyOwner () {
		message: "Only the contract owner can call this function."
		validation: "msg.sender == owner"
	}
	
	validator validNumber(x integer) {
		message: "The number must be greater than 4"
		validation: "x>4"
	}
	
	method example (x integer, name string, lastname string) -> x integer, name string {
		description: "This is a sample of method"
		validators: onlyOwner, validNumber
		events: XUpdated, NameUpdated 
	}
	
	event XUpdated (x integer){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el numero se ha actualizado"
	}
	
	event NameUpdated(name string){
		description: "Este evento es para notificar cuando el name se ha actualizado"
	}
}
```

The changes made are:
1. `Modifier` → `validator` (keyword change in both declarations)
2. `modifiers:` → `validators:` (keyword change in the method)
3. The new optional `DataStore` element was not instantiated as per rule 2
4. All formatting, whitespace, indentation, and comments were preserved exactly as in the original
